# INF 554 Assignment 5

## Description

From [http://data.worldbank.org](http://data.worldbank.org), download *Rural population (% of total population)* data for 20 countries and a year of your choice. In an HTML document named `a5.html`, load the data as CSV using D3 and present the data in a table, then draw a stem-and-leaf plot, a bar chart, and a scatterplot of the data. Axes are not required. Demonstrate good development practices in README.md (explain set-up, deployment, and use incremental commits). Publish on your USC SCF account ([see instructions below](#usc-scf-publishing-instructions)) and add a link to the **published** `a5.html` in `README.md`. All files, including `a5.html` should be stored in the repository. Describe and cite your source in `a5.html`.

## USC SCF Publishing Instructions 

All USC students are eligible for UNIX Computing Accounts for Students (SCF) accounts. Students that need to access USC UNIX resources may do so using their Student Computing Facility (SCF) accounts. Located at `aludra.usc.edu` and `nunki.usc.edu`, these two servers act as time-sharing hosts for all student accounts. See the [SCF](https://itservices.usc.edu/scf/) page for more details.

You can publish your work in one of several ways:

- Remote login using [SSH](https://itservices.usc.edu/ssh) or use [`scp`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/scp) (secure copy) from a Unix terminal (For a Unix-compatible terminal on Windows, use [Putty](http://www.putty.org), also available on the [ITS software pages](https://itservices.usc.edu/software/)).
- Connect with [SFTP](https://itservices.usc.edu/sftp) (secure FTP) using a client such as [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org).
- Use [MobaXterm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) (support both `ssh` and `sftp`).

__SSH Example__

```
$ ssh <username>@aludra.usc.edu  # username is your USC username as it appears in your USC email address
$ mkdir public_html  # automatically mapped by Apache to http://www-scf.usc.edu/~username
$ cd public_html
$ cat > a5.html  # paste what follows into a5.html; when done pasting, type Ctrl+D to send EOF to close the file
<html>
   <head>
       <title>HTML Page Template</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       Hello!
   </body>
</html>
$ chmod -R 755 public_html  # make readable by www user for Apache to access 
```

You should be able to see the page by going to: `http://www-scf.usc.edu/~username/a5.html`
